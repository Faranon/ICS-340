# ICS-340
A project I did in ICS 340 deals with nodes, edges, graphs, and algorithms. It comes with 4 deliverables that were due throughout the class. Deliverable A was a basic output of amount of nodes, edges, most outgoing edges, and longest edge 
between two nodes given in a graph. Deliverable B used brute force programming and dynamic programming to find the minimal amount of coins to make a change using various coin systems. Deliverable C used an algorithm called lowest cost first 
search to find the lowest cost to get to the start and goal node given a graph. Deliverable D is like Deliverable C but uses another algorithm called A* search to find the lowest cost to get to the start and goal node given a graph and another 
graph that contains the heuristics of each node.

Progress:
Deliverable A - completed
Deliverable B - in progress
Deliverable C - completed
Deliverable D - completed
